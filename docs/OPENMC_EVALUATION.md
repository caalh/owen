# OWEN — OpenMC Capability Evaluation Plan

A hands-on test matrix for evaluating what the **OWEN** VS Code / Cursor extension can
actually do with **OpenMC**. Every test is grounded in the real extension source
(`owen/src/`, `owen/package.json`) as of v0.1.0 — no aspirational features.

Run these with OpenMC installed and cross-section data configured
(`OPENMC_CROSS_SECTIONS` pointing at an `endfb-*.xml` / `cross_sections.xml`). Fill in the
**Score** column as you go.

> **How OWEN sees "OpenMC":** OpenMC has no dedicated VS Code language id. OWEN treats a
> `.py` file as OpenMC **only when it contains an `import openmc` (or `from openmc … import`)
> line** — see `src/util/detectLanguage.ts`. Diagnostics, run-as-OpenMC, geometry preview,
> and material insertion all key off that. **Always keep `import openmc` at the top of your
> test files.**

---

## 0. Prerequisites (do this once)

The repo does **not** ship a compiled `out/extension.js`. Build and launch the extension
host first:

```bash
cd owen
npm install
npm run typecheck     # esbuild does not type-check
npm run compile       # produces out/extension.js
```

Then open the `owen/` folder in VS Code / Cursor and press **F5** ("Run Extension") to
launch an Extension Development Host, OR install the packaged VSIX:

```bash
npx @vscode/vsce package -o owen.vsix
# then: code --install-extension owen.vsix
```

OpenMC sanity check (in the Python env OWEN will call — `owen.openmc.pythonExecutable`):

```bash
python -c "import openmc; print(openmc.__version__)"
echo $OPENMC_CROSS_SECTIONS   # must be set for any real run
```

## Scoring rubric

| Score | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Pass** | Feature works as described; output is correct and usable. |
| **Partial** | Feature runs but with caveats (wrong/heuristic output, missing data, manual fixups needed). |
| **Fail** | Command errors, does nothing, or produces unusable output. |
| **Blocked** | Couldn't test (missing dependency, no internet, no OpenMC). |

---

## Canonical test input — paste this into `pincell.py`

Use this correct-API pin cell as the workhorse for several tests below. It uses
`IndependentSource`, sets **temperature on cells** (not materials), and opens the statepoint
**Path** returned by `model.run()`.

```python
import openmc

# --- Materials ---
uo2 = openmc.Material(name='UO2')
uo2.set_density('g/cm3', 10.97)
uo2.add_nuclide('U235', 0.040, percent_type='ao')
uo2.add_nuclide('U238', 0.960, percent_type='ao')
uo2.add_nuclide('O16', 2.000, percent_type='ao')

zircaloy = openmc.Material(name='Zircaloy-4')
zircaloy.set_density('g/cm3', 6.56)
zircaloy.add_element('Zr', 1.0)

water = openmc.Material(name='Water')
water.set_density('g/cm3', 0.998)
water.add_nuclide('H1', 2.0)
water.add_nuclide('O16', 1.0)
water.add_s_alpha_beta('c_H_in_H2O')

materials = openmc.Materials([uo2, zircaloy, water])

# --- Geometry ---
fuel_or = openmc.ZCylinder(r=0.4095)
clad_or = openmc.ZCylinder(r=0.4750)
box = openmc.model.RectangularPrism(width=1.26, height=1.26, boundary_type='reflective')

fuel_cell = openmc.Cell(fill=uo2,      region=-fuel_or, name='fuel')
clad_cell = openmc.Cell(fill=zircaloy, region=+fuel_or & -clad_or, name='clad')
mod_cell  = openmc.Cell(fill=water,    region=+clad_or & -box, name='mod')
fuel_cell.temperature = 900.0      # temperature on the CELL, not the material
mod_cell.temperature  = 600.0

geometry = openmc.Geometry([fuel_cell, clad_cell, mod_cell])

# --- Settings ---
settings = openmc.Settings()
settings.run_mode = 'eigenvalue'
settings.batches = 100
settings.inactive = 20
settings.particles = 5000
settings.source = openmc.IndependentSource(
    space=openmc.stats.Box((-0.63, -0.63, -1.0), (0.63, 0.63, 1.0)),
    constraints={'fissionable': True},
)

model = openmc.model.Model(geometry, materials, settings)
sp_path = model.run(threads=4)
with openmc.StatePoint(sp_path) as sp:
    print('k-eff =', sp.keff)
```

Expected standalone result (outside OWEN): k-eff ≈ 1.3 for an infinite reflective UO₂ pin at
4 a/o U-235 (exact value depends on library/temperature). This is your reference.

## T1 — Extension activates without crashing

**Feature:** Activation (`src/extension.ts`). Regression guard for the prior bug where a
top-level `@supabase/supabase-js` import crashed activation for *every* command.

**Invoke:**
1. Launch the Extension Development Host (F5) or install the VSIX.
2. Open the **Output** panel → channel "Log (Extension Host)" / "OWEN" and the Developer
   Tools console (`Help → Toggle Developer Tools`).
3. Open `pincell.py`.

**Steps:** Watch for the line `OWEN extension activated` in the console; open the Command
Palette and type `OWEN:` — all 8 commands should be listed.

**Expected / pass criteria:** `OWEN extension activated` logged, no activation error,
all eight `OWEN:` commands visible (Open Lattice Builder, Validate Input File, Run
Simulation, Open 3D Geometry Preview, Search Reactor Library, Insert Material from Database,
Open Tutorial, Run Parameter Sweep). This confirms the lazy-Supabase activation fix.

**Score:** ☐ Pass ☐ Partial ☐ Fail ☐ Blocked — notes: ________________

---

## T2 — OpenMC syntax highlighting

**Feature:** Language highlighting. **Caveat:** OWEN ships TextMate grammars only for MCNP,
Serpent, and SCONE (`package.json` → `grammars`). OpenMC reuses the editor's **built-in
Python** grammar — there is no OpenMC-specific highlighting.

**Invoke:** Open `pincell.py`.

**Steps:** Confirm the file is recognized as Python and OpenMC API calls
(`openmc.Material`, `openmc.ZCylinder`, keywords, strings) are colored.

**Expected / pass criteria:** Standard Python highlighting renders. There is **no** OpenMC
keyword-specific coloring (e.g. `IndependentSource` is colored like any other identifier).
Pass = Python highlighting works; mark Partial if you expected OpenMC-specific tokens.

**Score:** ☐ Pass ☐ Partial ☐ Fail ☐ Blocked — notes: ________________

---

## T3 — OpenMC snippets

**Feature:** Snippets (`snippets/openmc.json`, scoped to `python`). Prefixes:
`omc_material`, `omc_pin`, `omc_lattice`, `omc_settings`, `omc_model`, `omc_pin_script`,
`omc_assembly_script`.

> **How they trigger (v0.1.2+):** the snippets are delivered by an explicit
> `CompletionItemProvider` (`src/completions/snippets.ts`), not only the declarative
> `contributes.snippets`. Earlier versions relied on declarative snippets alone, which only
> appear in the suggestion widget where the Python language server's completions out-rank or
> suppress them — so the prefixes looked dead. The provider loads the same snippet JSON
> (single source of truth) and serves the prefixes directly, so they appear on **Ctrl+Space**
> and as you type `omc_…`, regardless of your `editor.snippetSuggestions` /
> `editor.quickSuggestions` settings. The Python snippets only fire in files that
> `import openmc` (OWEN's OpenMC detection); MCNP/Serpent/SCONE snippets always fire.

**Invoke:** In a `.py` file that contains `import openmc`, type a prefix (or press
Ctrl+Space) and accept the completion.

**Steps:**
1. New file `snippet_test.py`; add `import openmc` on the first line.
2. Type `omc_pin_script` (or press **Ctrl+Space** and pick it), press Tab/Enter.
3. Type `omc_settings`, accept it.
4. Inspect the inserted code.

**Expected / pass criteria:** Full, correct-API code is inserted. Verify the inserted
script uses `openmc.IndependentSource(...)`, `openmc.model.RectangularPrism(width=, height=)`,
sets `cell.temperature` (not on Material), and ends with
`sp_path = model.run(...)` → `with openmc.StatePoint(sp_path) as sp:`. The inserted
`omc_pin_script` should run standalone with OpenMC.

**Score:** ☐ Pass ☐ Partial ☐ Fail ☐ Blocked — notes: ________________

---

## T4 — Validation / diagnostics (OpenMC API gotchas)

**Feature:** `OWEN: Validate Input File` (`owen.validateInput` → `validateOpenMC` in
`src/validation/validator.ts`). It flags five common OpenMC mistakes.

**Invoke:** Command Palette → **OWEN: Validate Input File** (or right-click in editor →
OWEN). File must contain `import openmc` to be detected as OpenMC.

**Steps:** Paste this deliberately-wrong file as `bad_openmc.py` and run validation:

```python
import openmc

src = openmc.Source()                                  # T4.1
prism = openmc.model.rectangular_prism(1.26, 1.26)     # T4.2
fuel = openmc.Material(name='UO2', temperature=900)    # T4.3
result = model.run(openmc_exec_kwargs={'threads': 4})  # T4.4
keff = result.keff                                     # T4.5
```

**Expected / pass criteria:** Five diagnostics (check the Problems panel), one per line:

| # | Line | Expected diagnostic | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| T4.1 | `openmc.Source()` | use `openmc.IndependentSource(...)` | Error |
| T4.2 | `rectangular_prism(...)` | deprecated → `RectangularPrism(width=, height=)` | Warning |
| T4.3 | `Material(..., temperature=...)` | set temperature on the **cell**, not the Material | Error |
| T4.4 | `openmc_exec_kwargs=` | deprecated → pass `threads=` to `model.run()` | Warning |
| T4.5 | `result.keff` after `result = …run(…)` | `model.run()` returns a **Path**, open via `openmc.StatePoint(...)` | Error |

Also run validation on the **good** `pincell.py` → expected "OWEN: No issues found."

**Score:** ☐ Pass ☐ Partial ☐ Fail ☐ Blocked — notes: ________________

---

## T5 — Insert Material from Database (NRDP)

**Feature:** `OWEN: Insert Material from Database` (`owen.insertMaterial`). Pulls materials
from `reactormc.net` live (`owen.nrdp.live`, default on) or the bundled
`data/nrdp-materials.json`, and inserts the **OpenMC** code variant when the active file is
detected as OpenMC.

**Invoke:** Command Palette → **OWEN: Insert Material from Database** with `pincell.py`
(or any file containing `import openmc`) focused.

**Steps:**
1. Place cursor on a blank line.
2. Run the command; pick e.g. **UO2 (3% enriched)** or **Water**.
3. Inspect inserted code.

**Expected / pass criteria:** A QuickPick of materials appears; selecting one inserts OpenMC
Python (`openmc.Material(...)`, `set_density`, `add_nuclide`/`add_element`). Because the file
is OpenMC, it inserts `openmcCode`, **not** the MCNP/Serpent variant. If both live fetch and
bundled snapshot fail you'll get "NRDP material snapshot is empty" → Fail/Blocked.

**Score:** ☐ Pass ☐ Partial ☐ Fail ☐ Blocked — notes: ________________

---

## T6 — Open Tutorial (deep links)

**Feature:** `OWEN: Open Tutorial` (`owen.openTutorial`). Reads
`data/tutorial-links.json`, then opens the chosen page on `reactormc.net` in your browser.

**Invoke:** Command Palette → **OWEN: Open Tutorial**.

**Steps:** Pick the **OpenMC** section, then a page; confirm your browser opens the URL.

**Expected / pass criteria:** Two-step QuickPick (section → page); selecting opens
`https://reactormc.net/...` for the OpenMC tutorial. Requires internet for the page to load
(the link generation itself is offline). Empty index → "tutorial index is empty".

**Score:** ☐ Pass ☐ Partial ☐ Fail ☐ Blocked — notes: ________________

---

## T7 — Run Simulation (run OpenMC end-to-end)

**Feature:** `OWEN: Run Simulation` (`owen.runSimulation` → `src/workflows/runner.ts`).
For OpenMC it opens an integrated terminal and runs
`<owen.openmc.pythonExecutable> <file.py>` in the file's directory.

**Invoke:** Open `pincell.py`, Command Palette → **OWEN: Run Simulation**.

**Steps:**
1. Set `owen.openmc.pythonExecutable` in Settings if your OpenMC Python isn't `python`.
2. Run the command. A terminal named "OWEN: Run" appears and executes `python pincell.py`.
3. Wait for OpenMC to finish.

**Expected / pass criteria:** Terminal launches, OpenMC runs all batches, prints
`Combined k-effective` in its log and your `print('k-eff = …')`, and writes
`statepoint.100.h5` next to the file. Info toast: "OWEN: Launched python for pincell.py
(openmc)." Fail = wrong executable, no terminal, or OpenMC import/cross-section errors
(those are environment issues → Blocked).

**Score:** ☐ Pass ☐ Partial ☐ Fail ☐ Blocked — notes: ________________

---

## T8 — 3D Geometry Preview

**Feature:** `OWEN: Open 3D Geometry Preview` (`owen.openGeometryPreview` →
`src/preview/extractor.ts` `extractOpenmcCylinders`). **Caveat — this is a regex/heuristic
parser, not a real OpenMC geometry build.** It scans the text for variable-name patterns
(`pitch`, `fuel_radius`/`fuel_or`, `clad_outer`/`clad_or`, `fuel_height`, and
`guide_tube_coords`/`guide_positions`) and draws three.js cylinders. It does **not** import
or run OpenMC. The webview loads `three` from `unpkg.com`, so it needs internet.

**Invoke:** Open a deck, Command Palette → **OWEN: Open 3D Geometry Preview** (opens beside).

**Steps:** Use this preview-friendly file `preview_pin.py` (note the recognized names):

```python
import openmc

pitch = 1.26
fuel_or = 0.4095
clad_or = 0.4750
fuel_height = 40.0
# (no lattice → OWEN renders a single concentric pin)
```

Then optionally test a lattice render with `guide_tube_coords`:

```python
import openmc

pitch = 1.26
fuel_or = 0.4095
clad_or = 0.4750
guide_tube_coords = [(2,5),(2,8),(2,11),(5,2),(8,8),(14,11)]   # drives a 17x17 grid
```

**Expected / pass criteria:**
- First file → a single concentric pin (fuel + clad annulus) renders; orbit/zoom works.
- Second file → a 17×17 grid of pins with guide-tube positions highlighted.
- A real-but-unrecognized script (e.g. variables named `r_fuel`, or a `np.full((17,17))`
  lattice with no `guide_tube_coords`) will fall back to **defaults / a single pin** — mark
  **Partial** and note what it drew vs. the actual geometry.
- No internet → blank stage (three.js CDN) → Blocked.

**Score:** ☐ Pass ☐ Partial ☐ Fail ☐ Blocked — notes: ________________

---

## T9 — Lattice Builder

**Feature:** `OWEN: Open Lattice Builder` (`owen.openLatticeBuilder` →
`src/panels/latticeBuilder.ts`). A webview grid painter that emits MCNP/OpenMC/Serpent
lattice code and inserts it at the cursor.

**Invoke:** Command Palette → **OWEN: Open Lattice Builder**.

**Steps:**
1. Set **Format → OpenMC**, grid 17, pitch 1.26.
2. Click **W 17×17** preset (places guide tubes + central instrument tube).
3. Read the code preview, then click **Insert at Cursor** into a `.py` file.

**Expected / pass criteria:** Preview shows
`lattice = openmc.RectLattice(...)`, `lattice.pitch = (1.26, 1.26)`,
`lattice.lower_left = (...)`, and a `lattice.universes = [...]` grid using names
`fuel_pin`, `guide_tube`, `instr_tube`. Insert places that code at the cursor.
**Caveat:** the emitted snippet references universe **names** (`fuel_pin`, etc.) you must
define yourself — it is a lattice fragment, not a runnable script. Pass = correct lattice
fragment inserted; Partial if you expected a complete runnable model.

**Score:** ☐ Pass ☐ Partial ☐ Fail ☐ Blocked — notes: ________________

---

## T10 — Run Parameter Sweep

**Feature:** `OWEN: Run Parameter Sweep` (`owen.runSweep` → `src/workflows/sweep.ts`).
Reads a JSON config, regex-substitutes values into a base file per combination, runs each
via `python <input>`, parses k-eff from stdout (`Combined k-effective = …`), and writes
`sweep-manifest.json` + `sweep-summary.tsv`.

**Invoke:** Command Palette → **OWEN: Run Parameter Sweep**, then pick the JSON config.

**Steps:**
1. Save `pincell.py` (from the canonical input) as the base, but make the enrichment a
   substitutable token. Change the U-235/U-238 lines to a single marker you can regex, e.g.:

   ```python
   uo2.add_nuclide('U235', 0.040, percent_type='ao')   # ENR line
   ```

2. Create `sweep.json` next to it:

   ```json
   {
     "baseFile": "pincell.py",
     "language": "openmc",
     "output": { "dir": "sweep_out" },
     "parameters": [
       {
         "name": "enrichment",
         "values": [0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05],
         "pattern": "add_nuclide\\('U235', ([0-9.]+)"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Run the sweep and pick `sweep.json`.

**Expected / pass criteria:** A progress notification runs 4 cases; `sweep_out/run_000…003/`
each contain a mutated `pincell.py`, an `owen-sweep.log`, and a statepoint. `sweep-summary.tsv`
lists `index / enrichment / exit / keff` with **increasing k-eff vs. enrichment**, and
`sweep-manifest.json` is written. k-eff column = `n/a` means the regex didn't match OpenMC's
stdout (`Combined k-effective`) → Partial. Note: `model.run()` keeps OpenMC's normal stdout,
so the parser should find it.

**Score:** ☐ Pass ☐ Partial ☐ Fail ☐ Blocked — notes: ________________

---

## T11 — Community Library (Search Reactor Library)

**Feature:** `OWEN: Search Reactor Library` (`owen.searchReactorLibrary` →
`src/community/browser.ts`, Supabase-backed). **Disabled by default**
(`owen.community.enabled = false`); requires `owen.supabase.url` + `owen.supabase.anonKey`.

**Invoke:** Command Palette → **OWEN: Search Reactor Library**.

**Steps:**
1. With defaults (community disabled), run the command.
2. (Optional) If you have Supabase creds: set `owen.community.enabled = true`,
   `owen.supabase.url`, `owen.supabase.anonKey`, reload, run again with `pincell.py` focused.

**Expected / pass criteria:**
- Default: graceful info message "Community Library is disabled. Set `owen.community.enabled`…"
  and **no crash** (this is the second half of the lazy-Supabase activation-fix verification).
- With creds: a QuickPick of approved models filtered to `openmc` (because the active file is
  OpenMC), insert-at-cursor / open-in-new-doc options work.
- **Likely-Partial for most users:** without public Supabase credentials this feature can't
  return data — that's expected, not a bug. Score Partial and note "no creds".

**Score:** ☐ Pass ☐ Partial ☐ Fail ☐ Blocked — notes: ________________

---

## Known caveats / things likely to not work yet

Honest read of the current code:

1. **No OpenMC-specific syntax highlighting.** OpenMC is plain Python to the editor; only
   MCNP/Serpent/SCONE have TextMate grammars (T2).
2. **OpenMC detection is import-sniffing.** A `.py` file without a literal
   `import openmc` / `from openmc … import` line is invisible to validation, run-as-OpenMC,
   material insertion, and the OpenMC preview path (`detectLanguage.ts`).
3. **3D preview is heuristic, not real geometry.** It pattern-matches variable names
   (`fuel_or`, `clad_or`, `pitch`, `guide_tube_coords`) and falls back to hard-coded defaults
   (pitch 1.26, fuel r 0.41, clad r 0.475, height 40). It can't read an actual
   `openmc.Geometry`, CSG regions, or `RectLattice.universes` built with NumPy. Expect
   single-pin fallback for most real scripts that don't use the exact recognized names (T8).
4. **Preview needs internet.** three.js loads from `unpkg.com`; offline = blank webview.
5. **Lattice Builder emits a fragment, not a model.** OpenMC output references undefined
   universe names you must wire up yourself (T9).
6. **Community Library is effectively off for most users** — disabled by default and needs
   Supabase credentials (T11). Its main current value is confirming it no longer crashes
   activation.
7. **Run/Sweep depend on your environment.** `owen.openmc.pythonExecutable` must point at the
   Python with OpenMC, and `OPENMC_CROSS_SECTIONS` must be set; otherwise runs fail for
   environment reasons (Blocked, not an OWEN bug).
8. **k-eff scraping is regex-based.** The sweep parser looks for `Combined k-effective = …`
   in stdout; anything that suppresses/redirects OpenMC's console output yields `n/a` (T10).
